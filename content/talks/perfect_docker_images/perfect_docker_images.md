## Summary

What would a perfect container image for your Java application be?  
Miniature, airtight secure, starting fast, memory lean, or all together? 
The annoying answer is: it depends.
In this session, we’ll treat container images like a product with clear requirements. 
Using a full-stack Spring Boot app with the Vaadin-based frontend, we will explore build and packaging approaches and their real-world implications in terms of startup speed, memory footprint, security posture, and scaling convenience. 
In the end, you’ll get a practical playbook for designing Java images based on your goals, including a decision framework and a reusable checklist.
