## Summary

What would a perfect container image for your Java application be? 

Miniature, airtight secure, starting fast, memory lean, or all together?

In this session, we will discuss the key aspects of efficient and safe Java container images. 
We will use a full-stack Spring Boot app with the Vaadin-based frontend to explore approaches, open-source tools, 
and best practices for building Java container images that fit perfectly into your requirements.
